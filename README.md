Feedback and Assistance: If you get stuck on something, the system can give you hints and tips to help you figure it out. It's like having a helpful friend who's always there to assist you.

Progress Tracking: The system keeps track of your progress, so you can see how much you've learned and what you still need to work on. It's like earning points in a game, but instead, you're earning knowledge!
